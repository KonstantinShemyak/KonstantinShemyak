Why I started to search for alternatives to WordPress?
======================================================

1. Security
-----------

My hosted WordPress has been compromized once. I was not able to find
how the attack was done.

Web search for "WordPress security" gives titles like
"11 Best Ways to Improve WordPress Security" or
"WordPress Security in a Few Easy Steps".
WordPress has evolved into so powerful tool that it requires own hardening.
I just do not need all of that power and I'm not willing to invest
(or waste) time in learning and maintaining security of one more system.

2. Backups
----------

A full backup of a WordPress site - that is, including comments and media -
is not part of the core software. Plugins (or other solutions) are required,
and they come with own glitches.

Why did I select Nikola?
========================

To be added.

What have I gained?
===================

Do not know yet.

What have I missed?
===================

* Ability to post "from anywhere", including mobile devices.
* Comments. I'll try the options Nikola supports; I need comments
  which I can back up.
